how to convert a column of date in this format Mar 3, 2017 into Mar 2017 in R

ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
To convert a column of dates from the format "Mar 3, 2017" into "Mar 2017" in R, you can use the lubridate and dplyr packages, or base R functionality. Here's how:

1. Using lubridate and dplyr
R
Copy code
# Load necessary libraries
library(lubridate)
library(dplyr)

# Example data frame
data <- data.frame(date = c("Mar 3, 2017", "Jan 15, 2020", "Dec 25, 2021"))

# Convert and format the date
data <- data %>%
  mutate(date = as.Date(date, format = "%b %d, %Y"),  # Convert to Date format
         date = format(date, "%b %Y"))               # Extract Month and Year

print(data)
2. Using Base R
You can achieve the same result without additional libraries:

R
Copy code
# Example data frame
data <- data.frame(date = c("Mar 3, 2017", "Jan 15, 2020", "Dec 25, 2021"))

# Convert and format the date
data$date <- format(as.Date(data$date, format = "%b %d, %Y"), "%b %Y")

print(data)
Output
For both approaches, the result will be:

yaml
Copy code
       date
1  Mar 2017
2  Jan 2020
3  Dec 2021
Explanation:
as.Date(date, format = "%b %d, %Y"):

Converts the original string to a Date object.
%b: Abbreviated month (e.g., "Mar").
%d: Day of the month (e.g., "3").
%Y: Four-digit year (e.g., "2017").
format(date, "%b %Y"):

Reformats the date object to display only the abbreviated month and year.
This method works efficiently for converting date formats in R. Let me know if you encounter any issues!

I want to filtered out games less than 25th percentile of users in R
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
To filter out games with fewer user ratings than the 25th percentile of the users column in R, you can calculate the 25th percentile (also called the first quartile or Q1) using the quantile() function and then filter the data accordingly. Here's how to do it:

R Code to Filter Games Below the 25th Percentile
R
Copy code
# Example dataset
data <- data.frame(
  name = c("Game A", "Game B", "Game C", "Game D", "Game E"),
  users = c(5, 50, 20, 100, 80)  # Number of user ratings
)

# Calculate the 25th percentile
q1 <- quantile(data$users, probs = 0.25)

# Filter out games with fewer user ratings than the 25th percentile
filtered_data <- data[data$users >= q1, ]

# Print the filtered dataset
print(filtered_data)
Explanation
quantile():

quantile(data$users, probs = 0.25) calculates the 25th percentile of the users column.
The probs = 0.25 specifies the first quartile.
Filter Condition:

data[data$users >= q1, ]: Keeps only rows where the number of user ratings is greater than or equal to the 25th percentile.
Filtered Dataset:

Games with user ratings below the 25th percentile are excluded.
Example Output
For the example data:

plaintext
Copy code
  name users
1 Game A     5
2 Game B    50
3 Game C    20
4 Game D   100
5 Game E    80
The 25th percentile (q1) is 20. Games with fewer than 20 users are removed:

plaintext
Copy code
  name users
2 Game B    50
4 Game D   100
5 Game E    80
Optional: Use dplyr for a Cleaner Workflow
If you prefer using dplyr, you can achieve the same result:

R
Copy code
library(dplyr)

# Calculate the 25th percentile and filter
filtered_data <- data %>%
  filter(users >= quantile(users, probs = 0.25))

print(filtered_data)
Conclusion
This approach ensures that games with insufficient user ratings (below the 25th percentile) are excluded from your dataset, making your analysis more robust. Let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance!

I want to create a new column for my cleaned_data and mark the winner of GOTY with 1 and other  0 in R
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
To create a new column in your cleaned_data dataset and mark the winner of Game of the Year (GOTY) with 1 and others with 0, you can use the mutate() function from the dplyr package. Here’s how:

Steps to Add the GOTY Column
Identify GOTY Winners:

Prepare a list or a condition that specifies which games won GOTY.
Example: Assume you have a vector goty_winners containing the names of the winning games.
Create a New Column:

Use mutate() to add a new column goty, assigning 1 to winners and 0 to others.
Code Example
R
Copy code
library(dplyr)

# Example cleaned data
cleaned_data <- data.frame(
  name = c("The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild", "Game B", "Game C"),
  release_date = c("Mar 2017", "Jan 2020", "Dec 2021"),
  score = c(97, 85, 88),
  users = c(23624, 15000, 12000)
)

# List of GOTY winners
goty_winners <- c("The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild", "Game C")

# Add the goty column
cleaned_data <- cleaned_data %>%
  mutate(goty = ifelse(name %in% goty_winners, 1, 0))

# View the updated dataset
print(cleaned_data)
Explanation
goty_winners:

A vector containing the names of GOTY winners. Update this list with the actual winners for your dataset.
mutate():

Adds a new column (goty) to the cleaned_data DataFrame.
ifelse():

Checks if the name of each game is in the goty_winners list.
Assigns 1 if the game is a winner and 0 otherwise.
Result:

The goty column is added to the dataset with binary values indicating winners.
Output Example
For the example dataset:

plaintext
Copy code
                                      name release_date score users goty
1 The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild    Mar 2017    97 23624    1
2                                   Game B    Jan 2020    85 15000    0
3                                   Game C    Dec 2021    88 12000    1
Tips
Ensure that goty_winners matches the game names in your dataset exactly (case-sensitive).
If you already have a column indicating GOTY winners (e.g., winner), you can create the goty column based on that.

  cores = 6,
  adapt_delta = 0.99,
  seed = 617
) for the prior term, how can I change the prior according to knowledge I have, for example I know tga is 90% media score and 10% users score, I want to assign critic_positivity and score(score given by critics) heavier weight in this model

To incorporate your domain knowledge into the prior for the Bayesian model (e.g., giving more weight to critic-related features like score and critic_positivity), you can specify informative priors for those predictors.

Here’s how you can adjust the prior argument in stan_glm to reflect this:

Steps to Modify Priors
Understand the Current Prior:

The current prior is weakly informative (normal(location = 0, scale = 2.5)), which applies to all predictors equally.
This means the model does not currently prioritize any predictor unless strongly indicated by the data.
Define Informative Priors:

For predictors like score and critic_positivity (where you know they have a larger influence), set priors with:
A higher mean (location) if you expect a positive effect.
A smaller standard deviation (scale) to reflect confidence in your expectation.
Assign Custom Priors:

Use the prior argument to define custom priors for each predictor.
For example, assign stronger priors to score and critic_positivity, and weaker priors to others.
Updated Code with Informative Priors
r
Copy code
library(rstanarm)

# Define the Bayesian model with custom priors
bayesian_model <- stan_glm(
  goty_status ~ score + user_score + critic_positivity + critics + user_positivity + log(users),
  data = data_past_years, 
  family = binomial(link = "logit"),
  prior = normal(location = c(1.5, 0, 1.5, 0, 0, 0),  # Custom means for predictors
                 scale = c(1, 2.5, 1, 2.5, 2.5, 2.5),  # Custom standard deviations
                 autoscale = FALSE),  # Disable autoscaling to preserve prior values
  prior_intercept = normal(location = 0, scale = 2.5, autoscale = TRUE),
  cores = 6,
  adapt_delta = 0.99,
  seed = 617
)
Explanation of Changes
normal(location = c(...), scale = c(...)):

The location vector specifies the prior mean for each predictor.
The scale vector specifies the prior standard deviation (smaller values indicate stronger priors).
Predictors are listed in the order they appear in the formula (score, user_score, critic_positivity, critics, user_positivity, log(users)).
Custom Prior Settings:

For score and critic_positivity:
Set location = 1.5 (reflecting a strong positive expectation).
Set scale = 1 (indicating high confidence in the effect).
For other predictors (user_score, critics, user_positivity, log(users)):
Use weaker priors (location = 0 and scale = 2.5) to reflect uncertainty or lesser influence.
Disable Autoscaling:

Setting autoscale = FALSE ensures the priors are not rescaled based on the data.
Alternative: Define Priors Individually with prior_summary
If you prefer to specify priors for individual predictors explicitly (instead of using a vector), use the prior_summary function:

r
Copy code
prior_summary(bayesian_model)
This allows you to review and adjust priors for each term manually.

Checking the Model
After fitting the model, inspect the prior and posterior distributions:

r
Copy code
# Check posterior summary
summary(bayesian_model)

# Visualize posterior distributions
plot(bayesian_model)
Interpreting Custom Priors
Stronger Priors on Critics:
The model will prioritize score and critic_positivity in its predictions unless strongly contradicted by the data.
Weaker Priors on Others:
Predictors like user_score will have less influence unless supported by the data.
This approach aligns the priors with your domain knowledge about The Game Awards' weighting of media scores. Let me know if you need further clarification or adjustments!

The issue arises because the custom prior definition you specified does not correctly match the structure and requirements of the stan_glmer function in the rstanarm package. Here's why this happens and how to resolve it:

Why the Issue Occurs
Custom Prior Mismatch

stan_glmer requires a single prior specification (e.g., normal(location, scale, autoscale)) for all fixed effects, not individual coefficients.
When you specify location = c(...) and scale = c(...), the function cannot match these to the individual predictors in the formula. This leads to invalid or undefined log-probability calculations.
Default Priors Work

When you use the default normal(0, 2.5, autoscale = TRUE), it applies the same weakly informative prior to all coefficients. This ensures that all coefficients are validly initialized, which is why the model builds successfully.
Solution: Use rstanarm-Compatible Priors
To resolve the issue, you can:

Apply a single prior for all fixed effects.
If you need custom priors for specific predictors, use the brms package instead, as it supports per-predictor priors.
Option 1: Single Prior for All Fixed Effects
To simplify and ensure compatibility with stan_glmer, use the same prior for all predictors:

r
Copy code
bayesian_model <- stan_glmer(
  goty_status ~ score + user_score + critic_positivity + critics + user_positivity + log(users) + (1 | genre),
  data = data_past_years, 
  family = binomial(link = "logit"),
  prior = normal(0, 2.5, autoscale = TRUE),  # Apply the same prior for all fixed effects
  prior_intercept = normal(0, 2.5, autoscale = TRUE),
  cores = 6,
  control = list(adapt_delta = 0.99),
  seed = 617
)
Option 2: Use brms for Custom Priors
If you want to specify custom priors for individual predictors, switch to the brms package, which allows this flexibility:

r
Copy code
library(brms)

# Define custom priors
priors <- c(
  set_prior("normal(1.5, 1)", class = "b", coef = "score"),
  set_prior("normal(0, 2.5)", class = "b", coef = "user_score"),
  set_prior("normal(1.5, 1)", class = "b", coef = "critic_positivity"),
  set_prior("normal(0, 2.5)", class = "b", coef = "critics"),
  set_prior("normal(0, 2.5)", class = "b", coef = "user_positivity"),
  set_prior("normal(0, 2.5)", class = "b", coef = "log(users)")
)

# Fit the Bayesian mixed-effects model
bayesian_model <- brm(
  goty_status ~ score + user_score + critic_positivity + critics + user_positivity + log(users) + (1 | genre),
  data = data_past_years,
  family = bernoulli(link = "logit"),
  prior = priors,
  cores = 6,
  control = list(adapt_delta = 0.99),
  seed = 617
)
Why Default Priors Work
When you use the default normal(0, 2.5, autoscale = TRUE), stan_glmer:

Applies the same weakly informative prior to all fixed effects.
Automatically initializes parameters in valid regions.
Custom priors require exact matching of the number of coefficients and predictors, which stan_glmer doesn’t support for vectorized priors like location = c(...).

Key Points
Custom priors in stan_glmer: Must be uniform for all fixed effects.
Custom priors for individual predictors: Use brms.
Default priors: Automatically ensure compatibility and stability for the model.
